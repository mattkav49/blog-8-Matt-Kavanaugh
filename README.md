Overall, building a website was a fun and rewarding experience. I used two .Rmd files along with a single .yml file to build my site.
Initially, the process went smoothly. I created a home page from my index.html file that introduces myself and provides an overview of my experience with R and favorite 
packages. Then, I added a second page called interests.html that discusses my future career goals and pursuits, in addition to how using RStudio and its many features
may be beneficial for my career in agricultural meteorology. Finally, I uploaded my latest resume into the repositiory and created a link to that on the site. In this way, employers can see what kind of experience I have and how it relates to my background in R. The one challenge I experienced was with regards to publishing the site.
Initially, Github Pages was having difficulty fetching and rendering all of my html files from the main branch of my repository. Hence, my interests and future pursuits page was not appearing on the site at first.
However, I found out that my interests.html file was initially saved elsewhere, and hence was not appearing as a component of my site. Once I moved all of the .html files into the proper directory, my issue was solved. 
All in all, I enjoyed building and publishing a webpage using Github and Github Pages. It is a really fun and dynamic way to combine skills using R, Git, and HTML. 
I look forward to using the skills that I learned in this lab to utilize these features more frequently in the future as I embark upon my career.
